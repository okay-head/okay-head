## 📌 About Me
Welcome aboard!

Hi I'm Shashwat jaiswal. A UI developer skilled in crafting dynamic interfaces. 

You can find my repositories dating back to early 2020's but I took a break for about 1.5 year and briefly explored cloud and networking. Back in the web dev space presently, I now understand why I needed a break.
 
## 🔧 My expertise and tools of trade

I specialize in building responsive and high-performance web applications that captivate users and deliver exceptional results. I strive to create seamless and visually engaging experiences.

**My stack dump-**

Technologies- React, Astro, Typescript, Tailwind, Node, Express, jQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS 

Tools - Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Firebase, AWS 

## 📚 What am I learning
Astro and Nextjs. I am also very excited to learn Golang

## 🌍 Open Source Advocate

I'm a huge fan of open source but haven't started actively contributing yet. I don't feel like I can make any difference with my mediorce-at-best quality of code. That's why I'm constantly involved in upskilling myself so that I can start to contribute to OSS sooner 🔮

## 📱 Hobbies

When I'm not sailing the high seas, I like to binge on reddit threads and pester my friends with my (obviously funny) puns. I read tech news, listen to podcasts, or sometimes use photoshop to create some god-awful memes. 

## 🥇 Achievements
Well
