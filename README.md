## 📌 About Me
Welcome aboard!

Hi I'm Shashwat jaiswal. A UI developer skilled in crafting dynamic interfaces. 

You can find my repositories dating back to early 2021's but I haven't been developing for that long. I took a break for about 1.5 year and briefly explored cloud and networking. Back in the web dev space presently, I now understand why I needed a break.
 
## ⛏ My expertise and tools of trade

I specialize in building responsive and high-performance web applications that captivate users and deliver exceptional results. 

**My stack dump-**

Technologies- 
React and react ecosystem - router, hook-form,  framer-motion, tanstack-query, zustand, vite/webpack  
Typescript, Tailwind, Zod, Node, Express, MongoDB, Firebase, PHP, MySQL jQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS 

Tools - Figma, Adobe Photoshop, AWS 

## 📚 What am I learning
Astro and a bit of design. Nextjs is constantly releasing breaking features, so i'm skipping it for as long as I can lol

## 🌍 Open Source

I'm a huge fan of open source but haven't started actively contributing yet. I don't feel like I can make any difference with my mediorce-at-best quality of code (still better than yours). That's why I'm constantly involved in upskilling myself and adapting to the best practices so that I can start contributing to OSS sooner 🔮

## 📱 Hobbies

When I'm not sailing the high seas, I like to binge on reddit threads and pester my friends with my (obviously funny) puns. I read tech news, listen to podcasts, or sometimes use photoshop to create some god-awful memes. 

## 🥇 Achievements
Well
